<h1 class="hone">The Battle For MVP.</h1>

<h2 class="htwo">There are a couple people in the running for an MVP right now. The top 2 are Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Both have a good debate for their own respective reasons. To start off, they both lead their team (The nets being the third seed in the east and the warriors being the second seed in the west) as of 1/14/2022. They both also are having one of the best seasons of their career, even past their primes. Honestly, it could go either way, now let's take a look at their stats.

<p class=mvppara>When Looking at the stats, KD is leading for points per game, rebounds per game, blocks per game, and has a higher field goal percentage. Curry is leading for assists per game, steals per game, and has a higher plus minus. For those of you who don’t know what a plus minus is, it is an advanced statistic to measure a player's impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's when the player is in the game (Thanks to Wikipedia for the help!). However, stats don’t always display the full story. Curry and Durant are both having one of the best seasons of their career, and Curry recently broke the 3 point shots made over a career. On the other hand, Durant is carrying a Nets team with an underperforming James Harden and without Kyrie (Note: Kyrie can play games now but I haven’t seen him play yet so it doesn’t count). My personal opinion for who I think will take home the MVP award is Steph because he is picking up where he took off last season and he is also taking his team further than Durant placement wise. In my opinion, his impact on the Warriors is a greater impact that Durant has on the Nets, let me know what you think (Email in the home page).</p>
