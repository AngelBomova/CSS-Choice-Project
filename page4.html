I'd like to give most of my credit to <br><br>https://www.basketball-reference.com/
<br> <br> it helped me a lot with some of my research. I would also like to give a shout out to <br><br>JxmyHighroller on Youtube, <br><br> got some of my ideas from there and he's a really good basketball content channel.
<br> <br> I would also like to show you this fun basketball game... (Note: It's very buggy)
