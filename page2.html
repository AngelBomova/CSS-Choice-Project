  The Phoenix Suns will avenge themselves from an upsetting finals loss to the Bucks last year. I think they will avenge themselves from their loss last year in 6 games. Instead of them losing in 6, they will win in 5, which I thought they should have last year. Chris Paul will finally be a champion and his legacy will be saved. The finals MVP will be Booker and yeah, thatâ€™s my prediction for the 2022 NBA Finals!
